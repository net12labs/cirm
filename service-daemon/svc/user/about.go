package user

/*

users come here for a reason:
-- improve their network performance (in some mission/project/job they do that we do not know about)
-- save money etc.
-- provide convenience


it can be a eason or a whole reason group

so as a provider - we only post a specific path which we resolve

THERE IS A REASON WHY THEY PICK ONE LINK OVER ANOTHER
and then the providers also have a reason why they promote one link over another (link=method, combination)

--- baobab always gives resons for people to shop
-- we can let them set up pointers and tags etc.
