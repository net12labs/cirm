Need to rceate a virtual file system I can access from go. 
Include all necessary methods for it to be compatible with os like file access 

the logic is: 
Volume -> vfs -> Directories -> files

The backing store is sqlite. 
Separate storage from inodes

We will be using it for small file - so no need for chunking.
